# Accessibility Starter template

## Why ?

I want to provide a good starting point to be able to build accessible from thestart for a new project.

- Headless CMS to seperate content
- Chakra-ui for best chance of having accessible UI as a shared package
- A simple react-Vite setup (but you can add react native apps or nextjs or remix projects)

## The components

- TurboRepo
- Strapi
- react + Vite
- Chakra - UI v3
- Playwright
- Pally and Axe
